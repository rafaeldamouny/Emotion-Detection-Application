- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **API Integration**: Watson NLP API
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Flask templating)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Deployment**: Localhost (development server)

This project is designed to be simple, intuitive, and efficient, making it easy for users to analyze the emotional content of text input.

## **Features**
